# Email-Notification-Service

The email notification service is responsible for saving/deleting email adresses per Trubudget user in a connected database. These email addresses are used to send configurable notifications to a connected SMTP server. If database and SMTP server are connected the notification.send endpoint can be used to send a user id. The database is checked if a email address is linked to the passed user id. If so a notificaiton is sent. It is recommended to start at the [Getting Started section](#getting-started)

## Database Configuration

This project is using knex to connect to the database where user email addresses are stored. Knex makes it possible to use a database you like unless it is supported.
Supported databases are:

| Database                   | Driver  |
| -------------------------- | ------- |
| PostgreSQL/Amazon Redshift | pg      |
| MySQL/MariaDB              | mysql   |
| SQLite3                    | sqlite3 |
| MSSQL                      | mssql   |

To install the driver for your database type in following command:

```
npm install <Driver> --save
```

## Environment Variables

To ensure all necessary environment variables are set correctly this section describes all environment variables across all services.

### Blockchain

For details see [Blockchain environment variables](../blockchain/README.md#email-service).

### Frontend

For details see [Blockchain environment variables](../frontend/README.md#email-service).

#### JWT_SECRET

The JWT_SECRET is shared between Trubudget's blockchain api and email-service. The endpoints of the email-service can only be used by providing a valid JWT_TOKEN signed with this JWT_SECRET. Since the blockchain is using the notificaiton endpoints and the ui is using the user endpoints the secret has to be shared.

## Architecture

As shown in the architecture section below, a script shall filter every transaction. This script is called `multichain-feed` and is part of the mono repository of Trubudget. The script filter transactions after notifications and saves them locally named with a timestamp as json files in the `/notifications` folder of the blockchain application.
An external process called `notification-watcher` watches the notifications folder and sends the user's ids parsed from the saved transactions via http request to the email service using the `notification.send` endpoint.
The email service checks if the connected database includes an email address for the passed user id. If an email address is found a notification is sent to the configured SMTP host.
Subscribing/unsubscribing to the email notification service can be handled by the user profile of the Trubudget frontend or by using the user.insert/user.delete endpoint of the email service.

## Email-Service

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to use our pre-set `docker-compose` cluster which starts the whole TruBudget application including all email components (that means you need to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download)).
The pre-set cluster contains:

- 1 Master-Node
- 1 Master API connected to Master-Node
- 1 Frontend connected to Master-API
- 1 Email-Service
- 1 Email-Database (Postgres)

When started, the Email-Service sends email notifications to the configured SMTP-host. The default configuration is:

- SMTP_HOST: host.docker.internal(localhost)
- SMTP_PORT: 2500

To configure another database type for storing the user email addresses check out the [database configuration section](#database-configuration)
To check what is configurable regarding email-notification service check out the [environment variables section](#environment-variables)
If a local SMTP mail server for testing purposes is needed [mailslurper](https://github.com/mailslurper/mailslurper) can be used
